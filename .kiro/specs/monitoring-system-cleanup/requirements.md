# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the need for a clean, failure-free monitoring system with properly documented remote access capabilities. The goal is to resolve any existing monitoring issues, establish bulletproof monitoring infrastructure, and ensure the existing Tailscale remote access setup is well-documented and validated for when MCP tools are unreliable.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Clean Monitoring System State

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want a monitoring system with no failures or stuck resources, so that I have reliable visibility into cluster health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring components are deployed THEN all pods SHALL reach Ready state
2. WHEN Prometheus is running THEN it SHALL successfully scrape all configured targets
3. WHEN Grafana is deployed THEN it SHALL connect to Prometheus and display dashboards
4. WHEN monitoring resources exist THEN they SHALL have no error conditions or events

### Requirement 2: Flux Controller Metrics Collection

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want comprehensive Flux controller metrics collection, so that I can monitor GitOps reconciliation health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Flux controllers are running THEN metrics SHALL be collected from all controllers
2. WHEN ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor are deployed THEN they SHALL discover all Flux endpoints
3. WHEN metrics are scraped THEN they SHALL include controller runtime and reconciliation data
4. WHEN Flux dashboards are loaded THEN they SHALL display current controller status

### Requirement 3: Bulletproof Core Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want core monitoring to remain operational even during storage failures, so that I maintain visibility during outages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storage systems fail THEN core monitoring SHALL continue operating
2. WHEN Longhorn is unavailable THEN Prometheus and Grafana SHALL use ephemeral storage
3. WHEN monitoring components restart THEN they SHALL recover quickly without persistent data
4. WHEN infrastructure issues occur THEN monitoring SHALL provide visibility into the problems

### Requirement 4: Remote Access Documentation and Validation

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want well-documented remote access procedures using the existing Tailscale setup, so that I can reliably troubleshoot issues when traveling or when MCP tools are unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN remote access is needed THEN the k3s-remote kubectl context SHALL provide full cluster access
2. WHEN MCP tools fail THEN SSH access via k3s1-tailscale SHALL allow direct troubleshooting
3. WHEN traveling THEN documented procedures SHALL enable quick cluster access from any network
4. WHEN switching between local and remote access THEN context switching SHALL be seamless

### Requirement 5: Service Discovery and Port Forwarding

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want reliable service discovery and port forwarding, so that I can access cluster services both locally and remotely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are deployed THEN they SHALL be discoverable through consistent naming
2. WHEN port forwarding is needed THEN it SHALL work reliably for all monitoring services
3. WHEN remote access is required THEN services SHALL be accessible through Tailscale
4. WHEN connections fail THEN clear troubleshooting steps SHALL be available

### Requirement 6: Monitoring Configuration Validation

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want monitoring configurations to be validated and working correctly, so that metrics collection is comprehensive and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ServiceMonitor resources are applied THEN they SHALL successfully discover targets
2. WHEN PodMonitor resources are applied THEN they SHALL collect metrics from all pods
3. WHEN metric relabeling is configured THEN it SHALL produce clean, useful labels
4. WHEN monitoring rules are deployed THEN they SHALL evaluate correctly without errors

### Requirement 7: Emergency Access Procedures

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want well-defined emergency access procedures using existing Tailscale infrastructure, so that I can troubleshoot cluster issues even when primary access methods fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP tools are unavailable THEN k3s-remote context SHALL provide full kubectl access
2. WHEN emergency troubleshooting is needed THEN emergency-cli.sh SHALL provide status and recovery tools
3. WHEN traveling THEN SSH access via k3s1-tailscale SHALL enable complete cluster management
4. WHEN local access fails THEN remote procedures SHALL be documented and validated

### Requirement 8: Monitoring Health Validation

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want automated validation of monitoring system health, so that issues are detected and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is deployed THEN health checks SHALL validate all components
2. WHEN metrics collection fails THEN alerts SHALL be generated immediately
3. WHEN dashboards are broken THEN automated tests SHALL detect the issues
4. WHEN monitoring problems occur THEN recovery procedures SHALL be triggered automatically
