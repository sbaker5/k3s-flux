# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Assess and clean up monitoring system state
  - Identify stuck monitoring resources and configuration conflicts
  - Create monitoring system health assessment script
  - Remove stuck namespaces, PVCs, and CRDs that prevent clean deployment
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Implement monitoring system cleanup automation
  - Create automated cleanup script for monitoring namespace and resources
  - Implement stuck resource detection and removal procedures
  - Add monitoring-specific cleanup functions to emergency CLI
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 3. Optimize Flux metrics collection configuration
  - Review and update ServiceMonitor configuration for controllers with services
  - Implement comprehensive PodMonitor for all Flux controllers
  - Configure metric filtering and relabeling for optimal performance
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 4. Validate and fix monitoring component deployment
  - Ensure Prometheus Core deploys with ephemeral storage and proper resource limits
  - Verify Grafana Core connects to Prometheus and displays dashboards correctly
  - Test ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor target discovery and metrics collection
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.4, 6.1, 6.4_

- [x] 5. Create monitoring health validation scripts
  - Implement automated monitoring system health check script
  - Create metrics collection validation and troubleshooting procedures
  - Extend existing health check system (from GitOps spec) with monitoring-specific checks
  - Add service reference validation to prevent configuration mismatches
  - **Add remote access validation for port forwarding procedures**
  - **Include process management best practices for port forwarding cleanup**
  - **Validate service names match actual deployments before documentation updates**
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3_
  - _Note: Builds on GitOps spec Task 10.3 health check foundation_

- [x] 6. Document and validate remote access procedures
  - Update remote access documentation with current Tailscale setup ✅ (docs/tailscale-remote-access-setup.md)
  - Create kubectl context switching procedures and validation scripts ✅ (included in guide)
  - Document emergency access methods using existing k3s1-tailscale SSH access ✅ (included in guide)
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4_

- [x] 7. Implement remote monitoring access validation
  - Create scripts to test Prometheus and Grafana access via Tailscale
  - Implement remote service port-forwarding validation procedures
  - Add remote access testing to monitoring health check scripts
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Create monitoring-specific system tests
  - Implement monitoring system validation as part of unified testing framework
  - Create failure scenario testing for monitoring recovery procedures
  - Add automated testing for both local and remote monitoring access
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 1.4, 4.4_
  - _Note: Integrates with GitOps spec Task 9 comprehensive testing framework_

- [ ] 9. Update emergency procedures and documentation
  - Add monitoring cleanup functions to emergency CLI (after GitOps spec refactoring)
  - Update troubleshooting documentation with monitoring-specific procedures
  - Create quick reference guide for monitoring system recovery
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 1.4, 8.4_
  - _Note: Depends on GitOps spec Task 11.8 emergency CLI refactoring completion_

- [ ] 10. Perform final system integration and validation
  - Execute comprehensive monitoring system deployment and validation
  - Test all remote access methods and emergency procedures
  - Validate monitoring system operates correctly under various failure scenarios
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4_
