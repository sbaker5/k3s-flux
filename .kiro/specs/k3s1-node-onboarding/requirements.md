# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for onboarding the second node (k3s1) to the existing k3s cluster. The current cluster has k3s1 as the primary control plane node, and we need to add k3s2 as a worker node to create a multi-node distributed storage setup with Longhorn. The onboarding process must maintain the bulletproof architecture principles where core infrastructure remains operational even during storage failures.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want to seamlessly add k3s2 as a worker node to the existing cluster, so that I can expand compute capacity and enable distributed storage redundancy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 boots up THEN the system SHALL automatically join the existing k3s cluster using the pre-configured token and server URL
2. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN the node SHALL be properly labeled for Longhorn storage participation
3. WHEN k3s2 is added THEN the existing workloads on k3s1 SHALL continue running without interruption
4. WHEN k3s2 joins THEN the Flux GitOps system SHALL automatically detect and configure the new node

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a storage administrator, I want k3s2 to participate in the Longhorn distributed storage system, so that I can achieve storage redundancy and improved performance across nodes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN the disk discovery DaemonSet SHALL automatically detect and prepare available storage disks
2. WHEN storage disks are discovered THEN the system SHALL create appropriate mount points and filesystem configurations
3. WHEN k3s2 storage is ready THEN Longhorn SHALL recognize the new node and its available storage capacity
4. WHEN Longhorn detects k3s2 THEN the system SHALL enable replica distribution across both nodes for high availability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a GitOps administrator, I want the k3s2 node configuration to be managed declaratively through Flux, so that the node setup is version-controlled and reproducible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN Flux SHALL apply the k3s2-specific node configuration from the Git repository
2. WHEN node configuration changes are committed to Git THEN Flux SHALL automatically reconcile the changes on k3s2
3. WHEN k3s2 configuration is applied THEN the node SHALL have the correct Longhorn disk specifications
4. WHEN GitOps reconciliation occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency between desired and actual node state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want k3s2 to integrate seamlessly with the existing networking setup, so that services remain accessible and load balancing works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN the node SHALL participate in the Flannel VXLAN network overlay
2. WHEN networking is configured THEN NodePort services SHALL be accessible through both k3s1 and k3s2
3. WHEN ingress traffic arrives THEN NGINX Ingress SHALL be able to route to pods on either node
4. WHEN Tailscale subnet routing is active THEN k3s2 SHALL be accessible through the VPN network

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a monitoring administrator, I want k3s2 to be automatically included in the monitoring and alerting system, so that I can observe the health and performance of the expanded cluster.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN Prometheus node-exporter SHALL automatically start collecting metrics from the new node
2. WHEN k3s2 is monitored THEN Grafana dashboards SHALL display metrics from both nodes
3. WHEN k3s2 experiences issues THEN the alerting system SHALL generate appropriate notifications
4. WHEN Flux controllers run on k3s2 THEN their metrics SHALL be collected by the monitoring system

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want k3s2 to maintain the same security posture as k3s1, so that the expanded cluster remains secure and compliant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 joins the cluster THEN the node SHALL have the same RBAC policies and security contexts as k3s1
2. WHEN secrets are deployed THEN SOPS-encrypted secrets SHALL be properly decrypted and applied on k3s2
3. WHEN k3s2 is operational THEN the node SHALL participate in the same network policies and security boundaries
4. WHEN Tailscale is configured THEN k3s2 SHALL have secure VPN connectivity with proper access controls

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive validation and troubleshooting tools for the k3s2 onboarding process, so that I can quickly identify and resolve any issues during node addition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN k3s2 onboarding begins THEN validation scripts SHALL verify pre-requisites and readiness
2. WHEN issues occur during onboarding THEN diagnostic tools SHALL provide clear error messages and resolution steps
3. WHEN k3s2 is fully onboarded THEN health check scripts SHALL confirm all systems are operational
4. WHEN troubleshooting is needed THEN comprehensive logs and status information SHALL be easily accessible
