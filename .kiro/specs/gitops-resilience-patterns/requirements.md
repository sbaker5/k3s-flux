# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses the critical need for resilient GitOps infrastructure patterns that prevent lock-ups, stuck reconciliations, and immutable field conflicts. The goal is to establish robust deployment strategies, recovery mechanisms, and preventative measures that ensure infrastructure changes can be applied safely without requiring destructive manual interventions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Immutable Field Conflict Prevention

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want infrastructure changes to be applied without immutable field conflicts, so that Flux reconciliation never gets permanently stuck.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Kubernetes resources have immutable fields THEN changes SHALL be applied through resource replacement strategies
2. WHEN label or selector changes are needed THEN they SHALL be implemented using blue-green deployment patterns
3. WHEN kustomization changes affect existing resources THEN compatibility SHALL be validated before application
4. WHEN immutable field conflicts are detected THEN automated recovery procedures SHALL be triggered

### Requirement 2: Safe Resource Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want infrastructure resources to be managed with safe lifecycle patterns, so that updates never leave the system in an unrecoverable state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure components are updated THEN they SHALL use rolling update strategies where possible
2. WHEN resources must be recreated THEN the process SHALL be automated and atomic
3. WHEN dependencies exist between resources THEN update order SHALL be controlled and validated
4. WHEN resource deletion is required THEN cleanup SHALL be complete and verified

### Requirement 3: Automated Recovery Mechanisms

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want automated recovery from stuck reconciliation states, so that manual intervention is minimized and system reliability is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN kustomizations are stuck for more than 5 minutes THEN automated recovery SHALL be initiated
2. WHEN immutable field errors are detected THEN affected resources SHALL be automatically recreated
3. WHEN HelmReleases fail repeatedly THEN rollback procedures SHALL be triggered
4. WHEN recovery procedures complete THEN system health SHALL be validated automatically

### Requirement 4: Reconciliation State Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want visibility into reconciliation states and early warning of potential issues, so that problems can be prevented before they cause system lock-ups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reconciliation takes longer than expected THEN alerts SHALL be generated
2. WHEN error patterns indicate immutable field conflicts THEN proactive warnings SHALL be issued
3. WHEN resource states drift from desired configuration THEN corrective actions SHALL be recommended
4. WHEN system health degrades THEN escalation procedures SHALL be initiated

### Requirement 5: Staged Deployment Validation

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want infrastructure changes to be validated in stages before full deployment, so that breaking changes are caught early and safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure changes are committed THEN they SHALL be validated through dry-run testing
2. WHEN kustomization builds succeed THEN resource compatibility SHALL be verified
3. WHEN changes affect critical components THEN staged rollout procedures SHALL be used
4. WHEN validation fails THEN automatic rollback SHALL prevent deployment

### Requirement 6: Resource State Consistency

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want infrastructure resources to maintain consistent state across reconciliation cycles, so that partial updates never leave the system in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are being updated THEN atomic operations SHALL be used where possible
2. WHEN multi-resource updates are required THEN transaction-like behavior SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN reconciliation is interrupted THEN state SHALL be recoverable and consistent
4. WHEN conflicts arise THEN resolution SHALL prioritize system stability

### Requirement 7: Emergency Recovery Procedures

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want well-defined emergency recovery procedures for when automated recovery fails, so that system restoration is predictable and fast.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automated recovery fails THEN manual procedures SHALL be clearly documented
2. WHEN emergency intervention is needed THEN procedures SHALL be tested and validated
3. WHEN system restoration is required THEN data preservation SHALL be prioritized
4. WHEN recovery is complete THEN lessons learned SHALL be incorporated into automation

### Requirement 8: Change Impact Analysis

**User Story:** As a platform engineer, I want to understand the impact of infrastructure changes before they are applied, so that risk can be assessed and mitigation strategies prepared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN changes are proposed THEN impact analysis SHALL identify affected resources
2. WHEN breaking changes are detected THEN migration strategies SHALL be provided
3. WHEN dependencies are affected THEN cascade effects SHALL be analyzed
4. WHEN high-risk changes are identified THEN additional safeguards SHALL be required
