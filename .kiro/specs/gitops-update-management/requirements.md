# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive update management system for the k3s GitOps cluster, providing automated update detection, safe patching procedures, validation testing, and rollback capabilities. The system ensures that infrastructure and application updates can be applied safely with minimal downtime and automatic recovery mechanisms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want an automated update detection system, so that I can stay informed about available updates for all cluster components without manual checking.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the update detection script runs THEN the system SHALL scan for updates to k3s, Flux, Longhorn, NGINX Ingress, and Helm charts
2. WHEN updates are available THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report showing current versions, available versions, and update criticality
3. WHEN critical security updates are detected THEN the system SHALL flag them with high priority indicators
4. IF no updates are available THEN the system SHALL report "all components up to date" status
5. WHEN the scan completes THEN the system SHALL log all findings to a timestamped update report file

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want a safe update application procedure, so that I can apply updates with confidence and minimal risk to cluster stability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applying updates THEN the system SHALL create a pre-update backup of critical configurations and data
2. WHEN starting an update THEN the system SHALL validate cluster health and abort if critical issues are detected
3. WHEN applying component updates THEN the system SHALL follow the correct dependency order (core → storage → monitoring → applications)
4. WHEN each component is updated THEN the system SHALL wait for successful reconciliation before proceeding to the next component
5. IF an update fails THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger the rollback procedure
6. WHEN updates complete successfully THEN the system SHALL run comprehensive validation tests

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want automated validation testing after updates, so that I can verify all systems are functioning correctly without manual testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN post-update validation runs THEN the system SHALL test Flux controller health and reconciliation status
2. WHEN validation executes THEN the system SHALL verify Longhorn storage functionality with test PVC creation and mounting
3. WHEN testing networking THEN the system SHALL validate NGINX Ingress routing and service connectivity
4. WHEN checking applications THEN the system SHALL verify all deployed applications are healthy and responsive
5. WHEN validation completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive health report with pass/fail status for each component
6. IF any validation fails THEN the system SHALL trigger automatic rollback procedures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want reliable rollback procedures, so that I can quickly recover from failed updates and restore cluster functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rollback is triggered THEN the system SHALL restore the previous Git commit state for all affected components
2. WHEN rolling back THEN the system SHALL use Flux to reconcile back to the known-good configuration state
3. WHEN reverting changes THEN the system SHALL restore backed-up data and configurations in the correct dependency order
4. WHEN rollback completes THEN the system SHALL run validation tests to confirm successful recovery
5. IF rollback fails THEN the system SHALL provide emergency recovery procedures and contact information
6. WHEN rollback succeeds THEN the system SHALL document the failure cause and rollback actions taken

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want update scheduling and maintenance windows, so that I can control when updates are applied to minimize disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling updates THEN the system SHALL support maintenance window configuration with start/end times
2. WHEN maintenance mode is active THEN the system SHALL prevent new deployments and alert users of maintenance status
3. WHEN updates are scheduled THEN the system SHALL send notifications before, during, and after the maintenance window
4. IF emergency updates are needed THEN the system SHALL support immediate update execution bypassing scheduled windows
5. WHEN maintenance completes THEN the system SHALL automatically exit maintenance mode and resume normal operations

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want update impact analysis, so that I can understand how updates will affect my applications and plan accordingly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing updates THEN the system SHALL identify which applications may be affected by infrastructure changes
2. WHEN breaking changes are detected THEN the system SHALL flag applications that may need configuration updates
3. WHEN API version changes occur THEN the system SHALL list resources that need manifest updates
4. WHEN storage updates are planned THEN the system SHALL identify applications with persistent data that need special handling
5. WHEN impact analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a report with recommended actions for each affected application

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cluster administrator, I want update history and audit trails, so that I can track what changes were made and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN updates are applied THEN the system SHALL log all actions with timestamps and component versions
2. WHEN changes are made THEN the system SHALL record Git commit hashes for before and after states
3. WHEN rollbacks occur THEN the system SHALL document the failure reason and recovery actions taken
4. WHEN querying history THEN the system SHALL provide searchable logs by date, component, or update type
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create monthly update summaries with success rates and common issues
