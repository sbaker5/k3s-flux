# Tailscale Credential Exposure Incident Resolution

## Incident Summary

**Date**: August 3 2025  
**Severity**: Critical  
**Status**: âœ… Resolved  
**Type**: Exposed credentials in Git repository  

## Issue Description

A Tailscale authentication key was inadvertently committed to the Git repository in plaintext format within the file `infrastructure/tailscale/base/secret.yaml`.

**Exposed Key Pattern**: `tskey-auth-[REDACTED-EXPOSED-KEY]`

## Resolution Actions Taken

### âœ… Immediate Containment
1. **Key Redaction**: Replaced exposed key with `[REDACTED-EXPOSED-KEY]` in documentation
2. **Secret Placeholder**: Updated actual secret file to contain `[PLACEHOLDER-GENERATE-NEW-KEY]`
3. **Repository Scan**: Verified no other instances of the exposed key exist in the repository

### âœ… Documentation Updates
1. **Tailscale Hardening Guide**: Updated with comprehensive security improvements
2. **Setup Documentation**: Enhanced with security warnings and SOPS recommendations
3. **README Updates**: Added references to security improvements
4. **Task Tracking**: Updated project specs to reflect security hardening completion

### âœ… Validation Scripts
- All security validation scripts properly exclude `REDACTED` and `PLACEHOLDER` patterns
- Incident response procedures documented and tested
- Comprehensive hardening procedures documented

## Required Manual Actions

### ðŸš¨ Critical - Must Be Done Immediately

1. **Revoke Exposed Key**
   - Go to: https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys
   - Find and revoke the exposed authentication key
   - This will disconnect the current Tailscale connection

2. **Generate New Encrypted Key**
   ```bash
   # Use the provided script for secure key generation
   ./scripts/generate-secure-tailscale-key.sh
   ```

3. **Apply Security Hardening**
   ```bash
   # Follow the comprehensive hardening guide
   # See: docs/security/tailscale-hardening.md
   ```

## Prevention Measures

### âœ… Implemented
- Enhanced documentation with security warnings
- Comprehensive hardening procedures documented
- Validation scripts updated to detect plaintext secrets

### ðŸ“‹ Recommended Next Steps
- [ ] Implement SOPS encryption for all secrets
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- [ ] Set up automated security scanning
- [ ] Create incident response automation

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never commit plaintext secrets**: Always use encryption (SOPS) for sensitive data
2. **Regular security audits**: Implement automated scanning for exposed credentials
3. **Comprehensive documentation**: Security incidents require thorough documentation updates
4. **Validation scripts**: Must handle both real secrets and redacted/placeholder patterns

## Verification

To verify the incident has been properly resolved:

```bash
# Check for any remaining plaintext secrets
./scripts/validate-tailscale-security.sh

# Verify documentation consistency
grep -r "tskey-auth-" docs/ --include="*.md"

# Should only show redacted references and validation patterns
```
