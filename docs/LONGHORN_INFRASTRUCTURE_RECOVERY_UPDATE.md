Documentation emphasizes the resilient design:
- Core services remain operational during storage failures
- Monitoring uses ephemeral storage for reliability
- Applications depend only on core infrastructure

### 3. GitOps Integration
All documentation highlights the complete GitOps integration:
- Fully automated deployment via Flux
- Infrastructure as code principles
- Automated reconciliation and health monitoring

### 4. Operational Excellence
Documentation reflects the comprehensive operational approach:
- Complete monitoring and observability
- Automated health checks and validation
- Well-defined recovery procedures
- Comprehensive troubleshooting guides

## Documentation Structure

The documentation now follows a clear hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── longhorn-infrastructure-recovery-completion.md (NEW - Main completion doc)
├── README.md (Updated - Quick access guide)
├── longhorn-monitoring-requirements.md (Updated - Monitoring specs)
├── architecture-overview.md (Updated - System architecture)
├── setup/
│   └── longhorn-setup.md (Updated - Setup procedures)
└── troubleshooting/
    └── README.md (Updated - Troubleshooting index)
```

## Cross-References and Integration

All documentation files now properly cross-reference each other:
- Main README points to completion document
- Architecture overview references implementation details
