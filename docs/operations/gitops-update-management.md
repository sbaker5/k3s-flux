# GitOps Update Management Operations

## Overview

This guide provides operational procedures for the GitOps Update Management system once implemented. The system provides automated update detection, safe application procedures, and comprehensive rollback capabilities for all cluster components.

## Current Status

ðŸš§ **Core Detection Infrastructure In Development**

The GitOps Update Management system specification has been completed with comprehensive requirements and detailed implementation tasks. **Core update detection infrastructure is currently in development** with foundational components being built. Recent implementation refinements focus on enhanced consistency and reliability through standardized API clients, centralized configuration management, and improved error handling patterns following established steering guidelines.

## Planned Operational Procedures

### Update Detection
```bash
# Check for available updates (planned)
./scripts/check-updates.sh --all

# Generate update report (planned)
./scripts/check-updates.sh --report --output json

# Check specific component (planned)
./scripts/check-updates.sh --component k3s
./scripts/check-updates.sh --component flux
./scripts/check-updates.sh --component longhorn
```

### Update Application
```bash
# Apply all available updates (planned)
./scripts/apply-updates.sh --all --maintenance-window

# Apply specific component updates (planned)
./scripts/apply-updates.sh --component k3s --backup
./scripts/apply-updates.sh --component flux --validate

# Emergency update bypass (planned)
./scripts/apply-updates.sh --emergency --component flux
```

### Maintenance Mode
```bash
# Enter maintenance mode (planned)
./scripts/maintenance-mode.sh --enable --notify-users

# Check maintenance status (planned)
./scripts/maintenance-mode.sh --status

# Exit maintenance mode (planned)
./scripts/maintenance-mode.sh --disable
```

### Validation and Health Checks
```bash
# Run comprehensive validation (planned)
./scripts/validate-cluster-health.sh --post-update

# Validate specific components (planned)
./scripts/validate-cluster-health.sh --flux
./scripts/validate-cluster-health.sh --storage
./scripts/validate-cluster-health.sh --networking
./scripts/validate-cluster-health.sh --applications
```

### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Automatic rollback (triggered by validation failures)
# Manual rollback to previous state (planned)
./scripts/rollback-updates.sh --to-previous

# Rollback specific component (planned)
./scripts/rollback-updates.sh --component longhorn --to-version 1.6.0

# Emergency recovery (planned)
./scripts/emergency-recovery.sh --restore-from-backup
```

### Monitoring and Reporting
```bash
# View update history (planned)
./scripts/update-history.sh --last-30-days

# Generate monthly report (planned)
./scripts/update-report.sh --monthly --format pdf

# Check update metrics (planned)
./scripts/update-metrics.sh --prometheus-query
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### GitOps Resilience Patterns
The update management system will integrate with existing resilience patterns:
- **Pre-commit validation**: Leverages existing validation infrastructure
- **Error pattern detection**: Monitors update processes for known error patterns
- **Recovery procedures**: Uses established recovery workflows

### Longhorn Infrastructure Recovery
Storage updates will integrate with Longhorn capabilities:
- **Volume snapshots**: Automatic snapshots before storage updates
- **Data preservation**: Ensures zero data loss during updates
- **Replica management**: Handles storage updates with proper replica coordination

### Monitoring Integration
Update processes will be monitored through existing infrastructure:
- **Prometheus metrics**: Update success rates, duration, and failure counts
- **Grafana dashboards**: Visual representation of update history and trends
- **Alert rules**: Notifications for update failures and rollback events

## Security Considerations

### Update Validation
- **Signature verification**: All updates verified before application
- **Rollback testing**: Regular testing of rollback procedures
- **Emergency access**: Secure emergency procedures for critical failures

### Backup Security
- **Encrypted backups**: All backup data encrypted at rest
- **Access control**: Restricted access to backup and restore functions
- **Integrity checks**: Backup validation before restore operations

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
- ðŸš§ **Update detection framework** - Core infrastructure development in progress with enhanced reliability patterns
  - Standardized API client implementation with consistent timeout and retry logic
  - Centralized configuration management across all detection scripts
  - Response validation and sanitization for external API calls
  - Standardized logging patterns using approved color-coded format
  - Proper module sourcing with error checking for shared libraries
  - Resource cleanup functions with trap handlers
  - k3s architecture awareness in version detection logic
  - Safe arithmetic patterns and error handling best practices
- [ ] Backup and restore system
- [ ] Update orchestration core

### Phase 2: Component Integration
- [ ] Component-specific updaters
- [ ] Validation engine
- [ ] Rollback management

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Impact analysis system
- [ ] Notification and monitoring integration

### Phase 4: Testing & Documentation
- [ ] Comprehensive test suite
- [ ] User documentation and operational guides

## Getting Started (When Implemented)

### Prerequisites
- Existing k3s cluster with Flux GitOps
- GitOps Resilience Patterns operational
- Longhorn Infrastructure Recovery deployed
- Monitoring stack functional

### Initial Setup
1. Review the [GitOps Update Management Specification](../gitops-update-management.md)
2. Follow the [Implementation Tasks](../../.kiro/specs/gitops-update-management/tasks.md)
3. Configure maintenance windows and notification preferences
4. Test in development environment before production deployment

### Daily Operations
1. **Morning**: Check overnight update reports
2. **Weekly**: Review update availability and plan maintenance windows
3. **Monthly**: Generate update summary reports and review trends
4. **Quarterly**: Test rollback procedures and update emergency contacts

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues (Planned)
- **Update detection failures**: Network connectivity or API rate limits
- **Validation failures**: Component health issues or configuration conflicts
- **Rollback issues**: Git state conflicts or backup corruption
- **Maintenance mode stuck**: Process failures or resource constraints

### Emergency Procedures
1. **Update failure**: Automatic rollback should trigger, monitor validation
2. **Rollback failure**: Use emergency recovery procedures with manual intervention
3. **System unavailable**: Use emergency CLI access and manual recovery procedures
4. **Data loss**: Restore from Longhorn snapshots and Git state backups

### Getting Help
- **Documentation**: [GitOps Update Management Guide](../gitops-update-management.md)
- **Troubleshooting**: [Flux Recovery Guide](../troubleshooting/flux-recovery-guide.md)
- **Emergency**: [Emergency CLI](../../scripts/emergency-cli.sh)
- **Architecture**: [Architecture Overview](../architecture-overview.md)
