- **Emergency Recovery**: Provides manual recovery procedures for critical failures
- **Rollback Validation**: Runs validation tests to confirm successful recovery

### üìÖ Update Scheduling & Maintenance Windows
- **Maintenance Windows**: Configurable maintenance windows with start/end times
- **Deployment Prevention**: Prevents new deployments during maintenance mode
- **User Notifications**: Sends notifications before, during, and after maintenance windows
- **Emergency Updates**: Supports immediate update execution bypassing scheduled windows
- **Automatic Mode Exit**: Automatically exits maintenance mode after completion

### üìä Impact Analysis & Reporting
- **Application Impact**: Identifies which applications may be affected by infrastructure changes
- **Breaking Change Detection**: Flags applications that may need configuration updates
- **API Version Analysis**: Lists resources that need manifest updates for API changes
- **Storage Impact**: Identifies applications with persistent data requiring special handling
- **Migration Recommendations**: Provides recommended actions for each affected application

### üìà Audit Trails & History
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Logs all actions with timestamps and component versions
- **Git Commit Tracking**: Records Git commit hashes for before and after states
- **Rollback Documentation**: Documents failure reasons and recovery actions taken
- **Searchable History**: Provides searchable logs by date, component, or update type
- **Monthly Summaries**: Generates update summaries with success rates and common issues
