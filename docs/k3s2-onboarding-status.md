# k3s2 Node Onboarding Status

## Current Status: Ready for Deployment

The k3s2 worker node onboarding infrastructure is **fully prepared and ready for deployment**. All GitOps configurations, cloud-init automation, and monitoring systems are in place.

## Completed Implementation

### âœ… Task 1: GitOps Configuration for k3s2 Activation
- **Infrastructure Configuration**: k3s2 node configuration files deployed in `infrastructure/k3s2-node-config/`
- **Storage Integration**: k3s2-node-config activated in `infrastructure/storage/kustomization.yaml`
- **Flux Kustomization**: Ready for automatic application when k3s2 joins the cluster
- **Longhorn Integration**: Node configuration with disk path `/mnt/longhorn/sdb1` prepared

### âœ… Task 2: Enhanced Cloud-Init Configuration
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms for k3s installation and cluster join
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time status tracking with HTTP endpoint on port 8080
- **Detailed Logging**: Complete onboarding process logging to `/opt/k3s-onboarding/onboarding.log`
- **Status Tracking**: JSON status file with step-by-step progress indicators
- **Validation Steps**: Pre-installation connectivity checks and post-installation verification
- **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in retry logic for transient network or service failures

## Enhanced Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
The cloud-init configuration includes a comprehensive monitoring system:

```bash
# Monitor onboarding progress
curl http://<k3s2-ip>:8080

# Example response:
{
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T20:30:00Z",
  "steps": {
    "packages_installed": true,
    "iscsi_enabled": true,
    "k3s_installed": true,
    "cluster_joined": true,
    "node_labeled": true,
    "health_check_ready": true
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Network Validation**: Pre-installation connectivity checks to k3s1:6443
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Service Validation**: Post-installation verification of k3s agent status
- **Cluster Join Verification**: Automated validation of successful cluster membership
- **Label Application**: Automatic Longhorn node labeling with retry mechanisms

### Detailed Logging
All onboarding activities are logged with timestamps:
```bash
# View real-time onboarding logs
ssh k3s2 "tail -f /opt/k3s-onboarding/onboarding.log"

# Example log entries:
[2025-01-31T20:25:00Z] Starting k3s2 onboarding process

```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Node Preparation
- Prepare k3s2 hardware/VM with Ubuntu 20.04+
- Ensure network connectivity to k3s1 (192.168.86.71:6443)
- Prepare additional storage disk for Longhorn (optional, auto-discovery available)

### 2. Cloud-Init Deployment
- Use the prepared configuration at `infrastructure/cloud-init/user-data.k3s2`
- Boot k3s2 with cloud-init support
- Monitor progress via HTTP endpoint on port 8080

### 3. Automatic GitOps Integration
- Flux automatically detects the new node
- k3s2 node configuration is applied from Git repository
- Longhorn automatically integrates the new storage capacity
- Monitoring systems automatically include k3s2 metrics

### 4. Verification
```bash
# Verify node status
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Check Longhorn integration
kubectl get longhornnode k3s2 -n longhorn-system

# Verify storage distribution
kubectl get volumes -n longhorn-system

# Test application distribution
kubectl scale deployment example-app --replicas=4
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

## Next Steps (Remaining Tasks)

The following tasks from the k3s1-node-onboarding spec are ready for implementation:

### âœ… Task 3: Pre-Onboarding Validation Scripts
- **Cluster Readiness Validation**: `scripts/cluster-readiness-validation.sh` - Validates k3s1 control plane health and API server responsiveness
- **Network Connectivity Verification**: `scripts/network-connectivity-verification.sh` - Verifies cluster network configuration and Flannel CNI setup
- **Storage System Health Check**: `scripts/storage-health-check.sh` - Validates Longhorn system health and storage prerequisites
- **Monitoring System Validation**: `scripts/monitoring-validation.sh` - Validates Prometheus and monitoring system readiness
- **Comprehensive Pre-Onboarding Script**: `scripts/k3s2-pre-onboarding-validation.sh` - Orchestrates all validation modules with reporting

### ðŸ”„ Task 4: k3s2 Node Monitoring Integration
- Update monitoring configurations for k3s2 node metrics
- Enhance Prometheus ServiceMonitor and PodMonitor
- Create k3s2-specific Grafana dashboard panels
- Implement alerting rules for k3s2 node health

### ðŸ”„ Task 5: Storage Discovery Enhancement
- Improve disk discovery DaemonSet error handling
- Add validation for storage prerequisites
- Implement storage health verification
- Create automated Longhorn node registration validation

## Testing and Validation

### Available Test Scripts
```bash
# Pre-onboarding validation (comprehensive)
./scripts/k3s2-pre-onboarding-validation.sh --report

# Individual validation modules
./scripts/cluster-readiness-validation.sh
./scripts/network-connectivity-verification.sh
./scripts/storage-health-check.sh
./scripts/monitoring-validation.sh

# Test k3s2 onboarding readiness
./tests/validation/test-k3s2-node-onboarding.sh

# Comprehensive system validation
./tests/validation/post-outage-health-check.sh

# Error pattern detection validation
./tests/validation/test-tasks-3.1-3.2.sh
```

### Manual Verification Steps
1. **Pre-Deployment**: Run comprehensive validation script
   ```bash
   ./scripts/k3s2-pre-onboarding-validation.sh --report
   ```
2. **During Deployment**: Monitor onboarding progress via HTTP endpoint
   ```bash
   curl http://<k3s2-ip>:8080
   ```
3. **Post-Deployment**: Validate node integration and storage distribution
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes -o wide
   kubectl get longhornnode k3s2 -n longhorn-system
   ```
4. **Application Testing**: Verify workload distribution across nodes
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment example-app --replicas=4
   kubectl get pods -o wide
   ```

## Rollback Procedures

If issues occur during deployment:

### Emergency Node Removal
```bash
# Drain node gracefully
kubectl drain k3s2 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data

# Remove from Longhorn
kubectl patch longhornnode k3s2 -n longhorn-system --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"allowScheduling":false}}'

# Remove from cluster
kubectl delete node k3s2
```

### GitOps Rollback
The k3s2 configuration can be temporarily disabled by commenting out the reference in `infrastructure/storage/kustomization.yaml` if needed.
