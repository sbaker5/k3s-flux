curl http://<k3s2-ip>:8080

# Example response:
{
  "status": "completed",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-31T20:30:00Z",
  "steps": {
    "packages_installed": true,
    "iscsi_enabled": true,
    "k3s_installed": true,
    "cluster_joined": true,
    "node_labeled": true,
    "health_check_ready": true
  },
  "errors": []
}
```

### Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Network Validation**: Pre-installation connectivity checks to k3s1:6443
- **Retry Logic**: Up to 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff
- **Service Validation**: Post-installation verification of k3s agent status
- **Cluster Join Verification**: Automated validation of successful cluster membership
- **Label Application**: Automatic Longhorn node labeling with retry mechanisms

### Detailed Logging
All onboarding activities are logged with timestamps:
```bash
# View real-time onboarding logs
ssh k3s2 "tail -f /opt/k3s-onboarding/onboarding.log"

# Example log entries:

```

## Deployment Process

### 1. Node Preparation
- Prepare k3s2 hardware/VM with Ubuntu 20.04+
- Ensure network connectivity to k3s1 (192.168.86.71:6443)
- Prepare additional storage disk for Longhorn (optional, auto-discovery available)

### 2. Cloud-Init Deployment
- Use the prepared configuration at `infrastructure/cloud-init/user-data.k3s2`
- Boot k3s2 with cloud-init support
- Monitor progress via HTTP endpoint on port 8080

### 3. Automatic GitOps Integration
- Flux automatically detects the new node
- k3s2 node configuration is applied from Git repository
- Longhorn automatically integrates the new storage capacity
- Monitoring systems automatically include k3s2 metrics

### 4. Verification
```bash
# Verify node status
kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Check Longhorn integration
kubectl get longhornnode k3s2 -n longhorn-system

# Verify storage distribution
kubectl get volumes -n longhorn-system

# Test application distribution
kubectl scale deployment example-app --replicas=4
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

# Remove from Longhorn
kubectl patch longhornnode k3s2 -n longhorn-system --type='merge' \
  -p='{"spec":{"allowScheduling":false}}'

# Remove from cluster
kubectl delete node k3s2
```

### GitOps Rollback
The k3s2 configuration can be temporarily disabled by commenting out the reference in `infrastructure/storage/kustomization.yaml` if needed.
