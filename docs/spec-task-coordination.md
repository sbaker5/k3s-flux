# Spec Task Coordination and Conflict Resolution

## Overview
This document outlines how tasks are coordinated across the three active specs to avoid conflicts and ensure proper dependencies.

## Current Spec Status

### Monitoring System Cleanup Spec
- **Status**: 4/10 tasks complete
- **Focus**: Monitoring system optimization and validation
- **Dependencies**: None (monitoring system is operational)

### GitOps Resilience Patterns Spec  
- **Status**: 4/12 major task groups complete
- **Focus**: GitOps reliability, validation, and emergency tooling
- **Dependencies**: None

### Longhorn Infrastructure Recovery Spec
- **Status**: 10/12 tasks complete (mostly operational)
- **Focus**: Storage system validation and documentation
- **Dependencies**: None (system is operational)

## Conflict Resolutions

### 1. Emergency CLI Tooling
**Conflict**: Multiple specs wanted to modify emergency CLI scripts
**Resolution**: 
- **Owner**: GitOps Resilience Patterns Spec (Task 11.8)
- **Integration**: Other specs add features after GitOps refactoring is complete
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Monitoring Spec Task 9 waits for GitOps Task 11.8
  - Plugin architecture allows domain-specific extensions

### 2. Testing Framework
**Conflict**: Both GitOps and Monitoring specs creating testing frameworks
**Resolution**:
- **Owner**: GitOps Resilience Patterns Spec (Task 9 - Unified Framework)
- **Integration**: Monitoring spec tests integrate as subset of unified framework
- **Dependencies**: Monitoring Spec Task 8 integrates with GitOps Task 9

### 3. Health Check Systems
**Conflict**: Overlapping health check implementations
**Resolution**:
- **Foundation**: GitOps Spec Task 10.3 (already complete)
- **Extension**: Monitoring Spec Task 5 extends existing system
- **Integration**: Monitoring-specific checks added to established framework

### 4. Longhorn Monitoring
**Resolution**: 
- **Current State**: Documented in `docs/longhorn-monitoring-requirements.md`
- **Implementation**: Future enhancement, not blocking any current work
- **Integration**: References added to relevant specs for future coordination

## Task Dependencies

### High Priority (Blocking)
None - all systems are operational

### Medium Priority (Coordination Required)
1. **GitOps Task 11.8** → **Monitoring Task 9** (Emergency CLI)
2. **GitOps Task 9** ↔ **Monitoring Task 8** (Testing Framework)
3. **GitOps Task 10.3** → **Monitoring Task 5** (Health Checks)

### Low Priority (Independent)
- Longhorn Task 11 (optional node health improvements)
- Most monitoring validation tasks (system is operational)
- Most GitOps resilience patterns (system is stable)

## Execution Recommendations

### Phase 1: Complete Current Work
- Finish remaining Monitoring Spec tasks (5, 7, 8, 9, 10)
- Complete Longhorn optional improvements (Task 11)

### Phase 2: Major Refactoring
- Execute GitOps Task 11.8 (Emergency CLI refactoring)
- Build unified testing framework (GitOps Task 9)

### Phase 3: Integration
- Add monitoring features to refactored emergency CLI
- Integrate monitoring tests into unified framework
- Implement advanced health checking

## Notes
- No critical blocking issues identified
- All core systems (monitoring, storage, GitOps) are operational
- Task conflicts resolved through clear ownership and integration points
- Future Longhorn monitoring enhancements documented for reference
