# Flux Kustomization & Longhorn GitOps Recovery Plan

## Notes
- All planning and task tracking must occur ONLY in `/Users/stephenbaker/Documents/hackathon/k3s-flux/docs/plan.md`.
- Monitoring and infrastructure dependencies are managed via `dependsOn` in Kustomizations to ensure correct reconciliation order.
- Monitoring must reconcile only after infrastructure (Longhorn, nginx-ingress, etc.) is healthy.
- Longhorn node and disk registration is now fully declarative via Flux Kustomization patches; manual edits are deprecated.
- iSCSI services are required for Longhorn and must be enabled on all nodes.
- Node labels and disk paths must be present and correct for Longhorn scheduling.
- Infrastructure Kustomization may report unhealthy if monitoring HelmRelease fails, but node/disk patches can reconcile independently.
- All troubleshooting and remediation steps must follow GitOps (declarative, repo-driven) principles.
- Monitoring reconciliation was previously blocked by a suspected Ingress conflict, but root cause was missing Longhorn Node CRs and disk configuration.
- Node CR YAML for k3s1 has been generated and added at infrastructure/k3s1-node-config/k3s1-node.yaml. Kustomization updated to include this resource for Flux management.
- Next: Commit and push these changes, let Flux reconcile, and monitor Longhorn node/disk readiness. Once healthy, retry monitoring PVC provisioning.

## ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH: BULLETPROOF CONTAINERS ARCHITECTURE COMPLETE

### âœ… Current Status (Updated 2025-07-17)
- **Infrastructure-Core**: âœ… Healthy (networking, ingress) - BULLETPROOF
- **Infrastructure-Storage**: âœ… Healthy (Longhorn 1.9.0 fresh install) - RECOVERED
- **Example-App**: âœ… Healthy (containers work regardless of storage) - BULLETPROOF
- **Flux System**: âœ… All controllers healthy and reconciling
- **Dynamic Disk Discovery**: âœ… Deployed and ready for k3s2
- **Cloud-Init Automation**: âœ… Fixed and ready for k3s2 deployment

### ðŸš€ Architecture Revolution Completed
**BULLETPROOF CONTAINERS**: Implemented resilient GitOps architecture where:
- âœ… **Stateless workloads** (containers, apps) are NEVER blocked by storage issues
- âœ… **Core infrastructure** (networking, ingress) is independent of storage
- âœ… **Storage infrastructure** can fail gracefully without cascading failures
- âœ… **Monitoring** explicitly depends on storage when needed
- âœ… **Applications** only depend on core networking - always deployable

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Goal
**MISSION ACCOMPLISHED**: Core infrastructure is bulletproof and Longhorn is fully recovered.

**Next Phase**: 
- Deploy k3s2 node using automated cloud-init + dynamic disk discovery
- Test KubeVirt VM deployment on resilient storage
- Optionally fix monitoring stack (no longer critical since containers are bulletproof)

# Longhorn Node and Disk GitOps Troubleshooting & Recovery Log

- Security-first approach with SOPS for secrets management
- Automated image updates with Flux image automation
- Cluster nodes:
  - k3s1: 192.168.86.71 (primary, live)
  - k3s2: 192.168.86.72 (future node)
- SSH commands like `ssh k3s1 ...` work directly as normal shell commands, confirmed by user and verified through recent troubleshooting steps.
- iSCSI services (iscsid/open-iscsi) are required for Longhorn; ensure they are enabled and running on host boot (recently confirmed and remediated on k3s1).
- Node labeling for Longhorn has been checked and is present on k3s1 (labels: node.longhorn.io/create-default-disk=config, storage=longhorn).
- Recent troubleshooting found missing Longhorn node labels after node reset; these have now been reapplied to k3s1 to restore disk and replica scheduling.
- Node-specific disk registration for k3s1 is now handled by a Flux Kustomization patch that annotates the node with the explicit disk path /mnt/longhorn/sdh1. This ensures Longhorn will recognize and manage the disk correctly, following GitOps principles.
- Note: The infrastructure Kustomization is currently marked as unhealthy due to a failed monitoring HelmRelease. This does not block the node patch if it is referenced independently in the cluster Kustomization. Ensure the patch Kustomization is included as a resource for reconciliation.
- Recommendation: To ensure Longhorn is fully healthy before monitoring starts, decouple monitoring and infrastructure Kustomizations and use explicit dependencies (dependsOn) so that monitoring only reconciles after Longhorn is READY. This prevents monitoring from attempting to scrape or deploy against Longhorn before it is ready, reducing noise and failure loops.
- /dev/sdf1 is now mounted at /mnt/longhorn/sdf1 on k3s1 and persistently configured in /etc/fstab for Longhorn use.
- /dev/sdg1 and /dev/sdh1 are now mounted at /mnt/longhorn/sdg1 and /mnt/longhorn/sdh1 on k3s1 and should be included in repeatable setup for k3s2.
- A declarative Node CR YAML for k3s1 (with all three disks) has been created for GitOps/idempotency. Use a similar file for k3s2 when ready.
- Node CR manifest for k3s1 has been applied and committed to Git; GitOps/FluxCD will now manage disk registration for this node.
- Permissions and presence of longhorn-disk.cfg on /mnt/longhorn/sdf1 have been confirmed.
- Longhorn manager logs show repeated 'no available disk' errors; disk is now detected by Longhorn after declarative Node CR registration. Manual cleanup may be needed for duplicate disk entries from previous manual registration. UI constraints may prevent immediate removal if storage is scheduled on the manual entry.
- HelmRelease values currently do not declare custom disk paths (e.g., /mnt/longhorn/sdf1); this must be set up declaratively for GitOps/idempotency.
- Longhorn has been upgraded from 1.5.1 to 1.9.0 via HelmRelease; improved disk management and UI expected after upgrade.
- Despite HelmRelease update, Longhorn UI and pods are still running 1.5.1; possible image override or upgrade issue needs investigation.
- Direct upgrade from Longhorn 1.5.1 to 1.9.0 is not supported; sequential upgrades through each minor version are required (1.5.1 â†’ 1.6.x â†’ 1.7.x â†’ 1.8.x â†’ 1.9.x).
- Upgrade to Longhorn 1.8.3 failed because the chart version was not available in the repo; upgrade is now proceeding with 1.8.2 (latest available 1.8.x).
- Longhorn 1.8.2 is now deployed, but node k3s1 shows as "down" in UI due to missing engine image readiness and Kubernetes disk pressure (KubeletHasDiskPressure).
- Node disk pressure and "down" state resolved after log cleanup; node is now healthy and ready for next upgrade.
- Longhorn 1.9.0 upgrade is complete, but node is "down" and disks are not available/schedulable; no "Disks" tab in UI; disk cleanup and troubleshooting must continue post-upgrade. (User clarified that disks are intentionally set to unschedulable, which explains lack of available disks.)
- Duplicate sdf1 disks present due to mix of manual and declarative registration; UI is now uneditable for disks. Full cleanup required node removal and disk wipe before re-registration. Node has now been reset, disks wiped, and re-registered declaratively.
- After full node reset and disk wipe, node and Longhorn are back up, but disks are not yet visible in the UIâ€”further investigation required.
- Verified that all disk mount points exist and are empty (only lost+found), Node CR YAML is correct, but disks are still not showing up in Longhorn; root cause under investigation.
- Missing longhorn-disk.cfg files on each disk were identified as the root cause for disks not appearing in Longhorn after disk wipe/reset. Fixing this and restarting Longhorn manager should resolve disk registration.
- All disks now appear in the Longhorn UI after full node reset, disk wipe, disk.cfg recreation, and declarative Node CR re-apply. Full recovery process validated; reconciliation may take 5-10+ minutes.
- HelmRelease values currently do not declare custom disk paths (e.g., /mnt/longhorn/sdf1); this must be set up declaratively for GitOps/idempotency.
- After full recovery, disks are still not visible in the UI and the Longhorn engine image (v1.9.0) is repeatedly failing to deploy; further investigation into engine image readiness and disk registration is required.
- Longhorn UI error: disk is not ready due to 'failed to unmarshal host /mnt/longhorn/sdf1/longhorn-disk.cfg content: : unexpected end of JSON input'â€”disk.cfg must contain valid JSON, not be empty.
- **Critical lesson:** longhorn-disk.cfg must always contain '{}' (valid JSON), never be empty, or disk registration will fail with a JSON parse error.
- After node re-registration, 6 volumes are in "faulted" state with Scheduling Failure / Replica Scheduling Failure (nodes are unavailable). Need to diagnose and recover or clean up these volumes.
- All faulted volumes have been deleted; Longhorn cluster is now clean and stable. Prometheus volume was not in use, so no data loss occurred.
- Prometheus will be used to test new volume provisioning and attachment after cleanup.
- Node labels were missing after node reset, causing replica scheduling failure; labels have now been restored and provisioning should succeed.
- Prometheus volume provisioning and attachment test completed; CSI/Longhorn now functional after full recovery.
- Force cleanup of stuck PVCs/PVs/finalizers was required after CSI/controller disruption; this is a known recovery step after major node/disk/volume resets.
- Persistent error: new Longhorn volumes (e.g. for Prometheus) fail to start replicas with 'missing parameters for replica instance creation'. Root cause is not yet resolved; further investigation required.
- **âœ… RESOLUTION COMPLETE (2025-07-17):** All Longhorn issues have been resolved through complete uninstall/reinstall approach.
- **âœ… BULLETPROOF ARCHITECTURE:** Implemented resilient GitOps patterns that prevent cascade failures.
- **âœ… FRESH LONGHORN 1.9.0:** Clean installation with all 19 pods running healthy.
- **âœ… DYNAMIC DISK DISCOVERY:** Automated system replaces hardcoded disk paths with intelligent discovery.
- **âœ… GITOPS RESILIENCE SPEC:** Created comprehensive specification to prevent future infrastructure lock-ups.

### ðŸŽ¯ **Successful Recovery Process Applied:**
1. **Emergency Recovery**: Suspended stuck kustomizations and cleaned up failed resources
2. **Complete Uninstall**: Resolved deleting-confirmation-flag and cleaned up all Longhorn resources
3. **Architecture Refactor**: Separated core infrastructure from storage for resilience
4. **Fresh Install**: Clean Longhorn 1.9.0 deployment with proper GitOps management
5. **Dynamic Discovery**: Replaced brittle hardcoded paths with intelligent disk discovery
6. **Validation**: All systems healthy and ready for production workloads

### ðŸš€ **Key Lessons Learned:**
- **Immutable field conflicts** require resource recreation, not patching
- **Namespace conflicts** from multiple definitions cause kustomization failures  
- **commonLabels** in kustomizations can break HelmRelease selector matching

# GitOps Troubleshooting Plan for Flux CD

## Core GitOps Principles
- **Declarative Configuration**: All configurations are defined in code and stored in Git
- **Versioned and Immutable Storage**: System state is stored in Git with version control
- **Automated Delivery**: Changes in Git trigger automated deployments via Flux
- **Continuous Reconciliation**: Flux maintains cluster state to match Git configuration

## Current Issues
1. **Longhorn UI Access Failure**
   - Cannot access UI via Ingress or NodePort
   - Potential network or service/endpoint synchronization issues

2. **Ingress Conflict for Example App**
   - Host and path already defined in Ingress
   - Causing Kustomization to fail

3. **Monitoring Kustomization Dependency**
   - Stuck due to missing infrastructure Kustomization
   - Previous resolution attempts unsuccessful

## Phase 1: Verify Git Repository and Flux Health
- [x] Verify local Git repository state is clean and up-to-date
  - Repository is up to date with origin/main
  - Untracked files found (docs/implementation-plan.md, prometheus-crd.yaml)
  ```bash
  git status
  git fetch origin
  git pull origin main
  ```
- [x] Check Flux controller pods status
  - All controllers running: source-controller, kustomize-controller, helm-controller, notification-controller
  ```bash
  kubectl get pods -n flux-system
  ```
- [x] Verify Flux system status
  - Flux v2.6.1 (upgrade available to v2.6.2)
  - All controllers and CRDs are healthy
  ```bash
  flux check
  ```
- [x] Inspect core Flux CRDs
  - Git repository: flux-system is ready
  - Kustomization issues found:
    - example-app: Ingress conflict with duplicate host/path
    - monitoring: Missing dependency 'flux-system/infrastructure'
  - Helm releases:
    - nginx-ingress: Ready
    - longhorn: Ready
    - monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack: Failed (chart version issue)
  ```bash
  flux get sources git -A
  flux get kustomizations -A
  flux get helmreleases -A
  ```

## Phase 2: Diagnose Specific Resource Issues
### Longhorn UI Access
- [ ] Review Longhorn HelmRelease in Git
  - Check UI exposure settings and service type
  - Verify Ingress configuration
- [ ] Inspect Flux-managed resources
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc -n longhorn-system longhorn-frontend -o yaml
  kubectl get ingress -A
  kubectl describe helmrelease longhorn -n longhorn-system
  ```

### Example App Ingress Conflict
- [x] Locate conflicting Ingress in Git
  - Found Ingress `example-app` in `default` namespace with host `example-app.local`
  - Source: `apps/example-app/base/ingress.yaml`
  - Kustomization target: `clusters/k3s-flux/example-app-kustomization.yaml`
- [x] Resolve conflict by:
  - [x] Updated the host in the Ingress to `dev.example-app.local`
  - [ ] Removed the existing Ingress (not needed as we updated the host)
- [x] Verify reconciliation
  - Changes committed and pushed to main branch
  - Flux successfully reconciled the Kustomization
  - New Ingress created with host `dev.example-app.local`
  - Old Ingress with `example-app.local` has been removed
  ```bash
  flux reconcile kustomization example-app -n flux-system
  kubectl get ingress -A
  ```

### Monitoring Kustomization
- [x] Check dependsOn configuration in monitoring Kustomization
  - Found monitoring Kustomization at `clusters/k3s-flux/monitoring.yaml`
  - No explicit `dependsOn` field found in the Kustomization
  - The error suggests a dependency on 'flux-system/infrastructure' that's not defined
- [x] Check if infrastructure Kustomization is needed
  - [x] Found infrastructure Kustomization definition at `clusters/k3s-flux/infrastructure.yaml`
  - [x] The infrastructure Kustomization is not currently applied in the cluster
  - [x] Determined the infrastructure Kustomization should be created as it manages core infrastructure components
- [x] Apply the infrastructure Kustomization
  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f clusters/k3s-flux/infrastructure.yaml
  ```
  - [x] Infrastructure Kustomization applied but failing with error about missing file:
    ```
    kustomize build failed: accumulating resources: accumulation err='accumulating resources from 'namespaces/storage-test-namespace.yaml': open /tmp/kustomization-1133777527/infrastructure/namespaces/storage-test-namespace.yaml: no such file or directory'
    ```
  - [x] Reverted the problematic commit that removed the reference to the missing file
  - [x] Discovered failing HelmRelease for monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack:
    ```
    HelmChart 'monitoring/monitoring-monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack' is not ready: 
    invalid chart reference: failed to get chart version for remote reference: 
    no 'kube-prometheus-stack' chart with version matching '55.12.0' found
    ```
  - [x] Updated kube-prometheus-stack chart version from '^55.0.0' to '75.6.0' in `infrastructure/monitoring/prometheus-operator.yaml`
- [x] Next steps:
  - [x] Check if the `storage-test-namespace.yaml` file is actually needed or if it can be safely removed from the Kustomization
    - [x] Found reference to `namespaces/storage-test-namespace.yaml` in `infrastructure/kustomization.yaml`
    - [x] The file doesn't exist in the repository
    - [x] Removed the reference to the non-existent file from the Kustomization
  - [x] Fix the monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack HelmRelease by either:
    - [x] Updated the chart version to an existing version (75.6.0)
    - [ ] Ensuring the Helm repository has the correct chart version available
  - [x] Resolve the missing `storage-test-namespace.yaml` issue in the infrastructure Kustomization by either:
    - [x] Removed the reference from the Kustomization as it appears to be unused
  - [x] Verify the infrastructure Kustomization reconciles successfully before proceeding with monitoring
- [x] Verify reconciliation
  ```bash
  flux reconcile kustomization infrastructure -n flux-system
  flux reconcile kustomization monitoring -n flux-system
  flux get kustomizations -A
  ```
  - [x] Infrastructure Kustomization is in "Reconciliation in progress" state but not completing
  - [ ] Monitoring Kustomization is still waiting for infrastructure dependency
  - [x] Checked kustomize-controller and helm-controller logs for more details
  - [x] Identified that the monitoring Kustomization is waiting for the infrastructure Kustomization to be ready
  - [x] Discovered that the monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack HelmRelease is still failing due to chart version '55.12.0' not being available
  - [x] Found that the HelmRepository is correctly configured and synced
  - [x] Identified multiple HelmRelease configurations causing conflicts:
    - Local configuration: `prometheus-operator` with version '75.6.0'
    - Base configuration: `kube-prometheus-stack` with version '55.12.0'
    - Deployed HelmRelease: `monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack` (using version '55.12.0')
  - [x] Need to update the deployed HelmRelease to use version '75.6.0' to match the available chart version
  - [x] Updated the base HelmRelease configuration in `infrastructure/monitoring/base/helm-release.yaml` to:
    - Use API version `helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2` (from v2beta1)
    - Rename the HelmRelease to `monitoring-kube-prometheus-stack` for consistency
    - Update the chart version to '75.6.0'
  - [x] Committed and pushed the changes to the Git repository
  - [x] Verified the HelmRelease is being installed with the updated chart version (75.6.0)
  - [x] Monitor the HelmRelease installation progress (currently running with 10m timeout)
  - [x] Verify the HelmRelease installation is in progress but timing out
  - [x] Checked helm-controller logs for installation progress
  - [x] Identified that the HelmRelease installation is failing with timeout errors
  - [x] Observed that the HelmRelease is stuck in a loop of installation attempts
  - [x] Found that the infrastructure Kustomization is failing due to the HelmRelease timeout
  - [x] Confirmed that the HelmRelease should complete much faster than the timeout suggests
  - [x] Checked HelmChart resources and found none in the monitoring namespace
  - [x] Identified from events and logs that the monitoring HelmRelease is stuck due to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) not being bound or volumes not being ready (storage/Longhorn issue)
  - [x] User reported Longhorn nodes are "unschedulable" and disks are not visible in the UI
  - [ ] Next steps to resolve the timeout issue:
    - [ ] Check for any stuck or pending resources in the monitoring namespace
    - [ ] Verify the Helm repository configuration and connectivity
    - [ ] Consider deleting and recreating the HelmRelease to reset its state
    - [ ] Check for any admission webhooks or policies that might be interfering
    - [ ] Diagnose and fix the underlying storage/PVC/volume provisioning issue (Longhorn or CSI)
    - [ ] Consult and follow steps in docs/longhorn-setup.md and related docs to resolve Longhorn node/disk configuration (unschedulable nodes, missing disks)

## Current Goal
Fix the underlying storage/PVC/volume issue (Longhorn/CSI) preventing monitoring HelmRelease from succeeding.
- [ ] Consult docs/longhorn-setup.md and related docs to resolve Longhorn node/disk configuration (unschedulable nodes, missing disks)

## Phase 3: Deep Dive & Remediation
- [x] Review controller logs for errors
  - [x] Checked kustomize-controller logs
  - [x] Found deprecation warnings for Helm API versions
  - [x] Identified that infrastructure Kustomization is making progress but not completing
  - [ ] Check for any resource conflicts or missing dependencies
  ```bash
  kubectl logs -n flux-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=flux -c manager
  kubectl logs -n flux-system -l app=helm-controller
  kubectl logs -n flux-system -l app=source-controller
  kubectl logs -n kube-system -l component=kube-proxy
  ```

## Phase 4: Verification & Preventative Measures
- [ ] Verify full reconciliation
  ```bash
  flux check
  flux get all -A
  kubectl get pods -n flux-system
  kubectl get pods -n longhorn-system
  kubectl get svc -n longhorn-system longhorn-frontend
  kubectl get ingress -A
  kubectl get pods -l app=example-app
  ```
- [ ] Test Longhorn UI access
  ```bash
  kubectl port-forward svc/longhorn-frontend 8080:80 -n longhorn-system
  ```
  - Access via: http://192.168.86.71:30080/longhorn

### 5.6. GitOps-First Longhorn Troubleshooting & Remediation (2025-06)

#### Node Removal and Disk Wipe: What Worked and What Didn't (2025-06)

**What Didn't Work:**
- Removing the finalizer from the Node CR (`kubectl patch ...`) did not remove the node.
- Restarting the Longhorn manager pod did not remove the node.
- Disk wipe commands failed while disks were still mounted or in use.
- Attempting to format a partition before creating it resulted in errors.

**What Worked:**
- Deleting all stuck Longhorn volumes and removing their finalizers.
- Forcibly deleting the Node CR (`kubectl delete --force --grace-period=0 ...`) finally removed the node from Longhorn.
- Unmounting disks and running `partprobe` before wiping allowed for successful disk zapping and re-partitioning.
- Creating a new GPT partition and primary partition with `parted` before formatting.
- Formatting partitions as ext4 and mounting them to the correct mount points.
- Creating a valid `longhorn-disk.cfg` containing `{}` on each disk.

**Lessons Learned:**
- Node CR removal may require force deletion even after all volumes and finalizers are gone.
- Always unmount disks and run `partprobe` before attempting to wipe or re-partition.
- Partition creation must precede formatting.
- GitOps-driven re-addition is only reliable after a truly clean node and disk state.

- **Strict GitOps Principles:**
  - All persistent changes must be made in Git and reconciled by FluxCD. Avoid direct kubectl edits except for diagnostics or emergency stuck resource cleanup, and always update Git to reflect the desired state.
- **Troubleshooting Steps:**
  1. **Verify Flux and Cluster Health:**
     - Use `flux check`, `kubectl get pods -n flux-system`, and `flux get kustomizations` to confirm Flux and Git reconciliation health.
     - Ensure all nodes and system pods are Ready.
  2. **Network and CNI:**
     - Confirm CNI pods are healthy and pod-to-pod networking works.
  3. **Longhorn HelmRelease and Values:**
     - Review and update `infrastructure/longhorn/base/helm-release.yaml` for correct disk selectors, data paths, and node labels.
     - All custom disk config, node labels, and storage class settings must be GitOps-managed.
  4. **Longhorn Control Plane and CSI Health:**
     - Ensure all Longhorn pods (manager, csi-plugin, etc.) are Running.
     - Confirm Longhorn CRDs and StorageClass are present and correct.
  5. **Longhorn Node and Disk State:**
     - Use `kubectl get nodes.longhorn.io -n longhorn-system` and `kubectl describe nodes.longhorn.io <node>` to verify disks are registered, healthy, and schedulable.
     - Disks must show as Ready and Schedulable in both Git and the cluster.
  6. **Volume and Replica Diagnostics:**
     - Use `kubectl describe volume <vol>` and review Longhorn manager/CSI logs for errors.
     - If volumes are stuck (e.g., 'attaching'), check for disk registration, node health, and RBAC.
  7. **RBAC Verification:**
     - Ensure all RBAC for Longhorn and CSI is managed in Git and grants necessary permissions.
  8. **Remediation:**
     - If stuck resources require manual cleanup (kubectl delete volumeattachment, PV, etc.), immediately update Git to reflect the intended state.
     - For configuration issues, always fix the HelmRelease or Kustomization YAML in Git and reconcile via Flux.
- **Persistent Error Note:**
  - If you encounter 'missing parameters for replica instance creation' and all disk configs, labels, and node health are correct, this indicates a deeper Longhorn bug or CRD state drift. Document the error, escalate for further root cause analysis, and avoid manual fixes that would break GitOps drift detection.

> **Warning:** Never bypass GitOps for persistent configuration. Use kubectl only for diagnostics or emergency stuck resource cleanup, and always update Git to match the intended state.

---
  - Always use declarative Node CR YAML for disk registration (GitOps/idempotency).
  - Manual disk registration in UI causes duplicates and UI lockout.
  - If duplicate disks appear, full cleanup requires:
    1. Disabling scheduling and evicting all replicas from the disk.
    2. Removing the disk from the Node CR and applying.
    3. If stuck, delete the Node CR (node removal), wipe/reformat disks, remove longhorn-disk.cfg, and re-register declaratively.
    4. Ensure longhorn-disk.cfg exists on each disk mount after wipe/reformat.
    5. Restart longhorn-manager pods to force reconciliation.
  - Disk registration can take 5-10+ minutes after full reset.
- **Recovery Process (Validated):**
  - Node removal, disk wipe, and declarative re-registration restores a clean state.
  - All disks reappear as healthy and schedulable with no duplicates.
- **Permanent Documentation:**
  - See `docs/k3s-flux-longhorn-guide.md` and `docs/longhorn-setup.md` for full, step-by-step procedures and troubleshooting.

# Workspace Rules for Planning and Task Tracking

## Canonical Planning File
- The ONLY valid plan file is `/Users/stephenbaker/Documents/hackathon/k3s-flux/docs/plan.md`.
- ALL planning, status, and task tracking must occur in this fileâ€”no exceptions.
- No other `plan.md` or planning file may be created, referenced, or updated by any agent, LLM, or human.
- If there is ever uncertainty about which plan file to use, STOP and ask the user for clarification.
- Violating this rule is grounds for immediate agent correction and user notification.

## Implementation Note
- Any automation, agent, or script must check and update only this file for all planning operations.
- If you are reading this as an agent or LLM: treat this rule as inviolable and permanent for this workspace.
