# Flux Alerting Strategy

This document describes the comprehensive alerting strategy for GitOps resilience patterns in our k3s cluster.

## Overview

The alerting system is designed to detect and notify about GitOps-specific issues that could impact system reliability and deployment success. It focuses on proactive detection of stuck reconciliations, performance degradation, and resource conflicts.

## Alert Categories

### 1. Reconciliation Health Alerts

**Purpose**: Detect when Flux reconciliation processes are stuck or failing

#### FluxKustomizationStuck
- **Threshold**: No successful reconciliation in 10 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Kustomizations should reconcile regularly; 10 minutes allows for normal retry cycles

#### FluxHelmReleaseStuck  
- **Threshold**: No successful reconciliation in 10 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Helm releases may take longer due to chart complexity, but 10 minutes indicates issues

#### FluxGitRepositoryStuck
- **Threshold**: No successful reconciliation in 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Git sources should sync frequently; delays often indicate connectivity issues

### 2. Performance and Error Rate Alerts

**Purpose**: Detect performance degradation and high error rates

#### FluxHighReconciliationErrorRate
- **Threshold**: >10% error rate over 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Some transient errors are normal, but >10% indicates systemic issues

#### FluxSlowReconciliation
- **Threshold**: 95th percentile >30 seconds over 10 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Normal reconciliation should be fast; slow times indicate resource constraints

### 3. Controller Health Alerts

**Purpose**: Monitor Flux controller availability and health

#### FluxControllerDown
- **Threshold**: Controller not responding to metrics scraping
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Controller unavailability breaks GitOps entirely

#### FluxControllerNoActiveWorkers
- **Threshold**: Zero active workers for 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: May indicate deadlock or configuration issues

#### FluxControllerHighWorkqueueDepth
- **Threshold**: >100 items in workqueue for 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: High backlog indicates performance issues or stuck reconciliations

### 4. System Health Alerts

**Purpose**: Monitor overall GitOps system health

#### FluxSystemDegraded
- **Threshold**: >20% of resources in failed state for 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Rationale**: High failure rate indicates systemic issues requiring immediate attention

### 5. GitOps Resilience Pattern Alerts

**Purpose**: Detect common GitOps operational issues

#### GitOpsResourceStuckTerminating
- **Threshold**: Pod stuck terminating for 5 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Stuck termination can block deployments and indicate finalizer issues

#### GitOpsNamespaceStuckTerminating
- **Threshold**: Namespace stuck terminating for 10 minutes
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Rationale**: Critical issue that can completely block GitOps operations

#### GitOpsDeploymentRolloutStuck
- **Threshold**: Deployment rollout stuck for 10 minutes
- **Severity**: Warning
- **Rationale**: Allows time for normal rollout processes while catching stuck states

#### GitOpsStatefulSetRolloutStuck
- **Threshold**: StatefulSet rollout stuck for 15 minutes
- **Severity**: Critical
- **Rationale**: StatefulSet issues are more critical due to data persistence concerns

## Alert Thresholds Rationale

### Time-based Thresholds

| Alert Type | Threshold | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| Git Source Sync | 5 minutes | Git operations should be fast; delays indicate connectivity issues |
| Kustomization/Helm | 10 minutes | Allows for complex resource processing and retry cycles |
| Controller Health | 1-5 minutes | Controllers should be consistently available |
| Resource Termination | 5-10 minutes | Allows for graceful shutdown while catching stuck states |
| Rollout Issues | 10-15 minutes | Balances normal rollout time with stuck detection |

### Rate-based Thresholds

| Metric | Threshold | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Error Rate | >10% | Some errors are normal; >10% indicates systemic issues |
| Performance (95th percentile) | >30 seconds | Normal reconciliation should be sub-second to few seconds |
| System Degradation | >20% failed | Significant portion failing indicates systemic issues |
| Workqueue Depth | >100 items | High backlog indicates performance bottleneck |

## Alert Escalation Strategy

### Severity Levels

#### Critical Alerts
- **Response Time**: Immediate (within 5 minutes)
- **Examples**: Controller down, system degraded, namespace stuck
- **Actions**: Immediate investigation and remediation required

#### Warning Alerts
- **Response Time**: Within 30 minutes during business hours
- **Examples**: Stuck reconciliations, performance issues, resource conflicts
- **Actions**: Investigation and planned remediation

### Escalation Paths

1. **Initial Alert**: Notification to operations team
2. **15 minutes unresolved**: Escalate to senior operations
3. **30 minutes unresolved**: Escalate to engineering team
4. **1 hour unresolved**: Escalate to management

## Alert Suppression and Grouping

### Grouping Strategy
- Group by `cluster` and `component` to reduce noise
- Group related alerts (e.g., all controller health alerts)
- Separate GitOps-specific alerts from general infrastructure

### Suppression Rules
- Suppress downstream alerts when upstream components fail
- Suppress reconciliation alerts during planned maintenance
- Suppress performance alerts during known high-load periods

## Monitoring Integration

### Prometheus Configuration
- Alerts are defined in PrometheusRule CRDs
- Core monitoring stack automatically discovers rules
- Rules are evaluated every 30-60 seconds based on criticality

### Grafana Integration
- Alerts visible in Grafana dashboards
- Alert annotations provide troubleshooting guidance
- Links to relevant logs and metrics

## Testing and Validation

### Alert Testing Strategy
1. **Synthetic Testing**: Create test scenarios to trigger alerts
2. **Chaos Engineering**: Use controlled failures to validate alerting
3. **Regular Review**: Monthly review of alert effectiveness and false positives

### Validation Scenarios
- Simulate stuck reconciliations
- Test controller failures
- Validate performance degradation detection
- Test resource conflict scenarios

## Maintenance and Tuning

### Regular Review Process
1. **Weekly**: Review alert frequency and false positives
2. **Monthly**: Analyze alert effectiveness and response times
3. **Quarterly**: Review and adjust thresholds based on system behavior

### Threshold Tuning Guidelines
- Monitor alert frequency vs. actual issues
- Adjust thresholds based on system performance characteristics
- Consider seasonal or usage pattern variations
- Balance sensitivity vs. noise reduction

## Troubleshooting Integration

Each alert includes:
- **Clear description** of the issue
- **Potential causes** based on common scenarios
- **Specific troubleshooting steps** with kubectl commands
- **Links to relevant documentation** and runbooks

This ensures alerts are actionable and reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR).

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements
1. **Machine Learning**: Anomaly detection for dynamic thresholds
2. **Predictive Alerts**: Early warning based on trend analysis
3. **Auto-remediation**: Automated responses for common issues
4. **Integration**: Enhanced integration with incident management systems

### Metrics to Track
- Alert accuracy (true positive rate)
- Mean time to detection (MTTD)
- Mean time to resolution (MTTR)
- Alert fatigue metrics (acknowledgment rates)
