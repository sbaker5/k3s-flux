# Task 2.3 Completion Summary: Write Alert Rules for Stuck Reconciliations

## Overview

Successfully implemented comprehensive PrometheusRule resources for monitoring Flux reconciliation health and GitOps resilience patterns. The alerting system provides proactive detection of stuck reconciliations, performance degradation, and operational issues.

## Deliverables Created

### 1. Core Alert Rules (`flux-alerts.yaml`)
- **9 alert rules** covering Flux-specific monitoring
- **1 recording rule** for health score calculation
- **4 alert groups**: reconciliation stuck, failures, controller health, system health

#### Key Alerts:
- `FluxKustomizationStuck` - Detects stuck Kustomization reconciliations (>10min)
- `FluxHelmReleaseStuck` - Detects stuck HelmRelease reconciliations (>10min)  
- `FluxGitRepositoryStuck` - Detects stuck Git source reconciliations (>5min)
- `FluxHighReconciliationErrorRate` - High error rate detection (>10%)
- `FluxControllerDown` - Controller availability monitoring
- `FluxSystemDegraded` - System-wide health monitoring (>20% failure rate)

### 2. GitOps Resilience Alert Rules (`gitops-resilience-alerts.yaml`)
- **8 alert rules** covering operational resilience patterns
- **2 recording rules** for system health and performance metrics
- **4 alert groups**: resilience patterns, deployment health, resource conflicts, performance

#### Key Alerts:
- `GitOpsResourceStuckTerminating` - Detects stuck pod termination
- `GitOpsNamespaceStuckTerminating` - Critical namespace termination issues
- `GitOpsDeploymentRolloutStuck` - Stuck deployment rollouts
- `GitOpsResourceConflict` - Resource management conflicts
- `GitOpsCRDMissing` - Missing Custom Resource Definitions

### 3. Documentation and Testing
- **Alerting Strategy Document** (`docs/monitoring/flux-alerting-strategy.md`)
- **Alert Rule Test Script** (`scripts/test-alert-rules.sh`)
- **Integration with existing monitoring stack**

## Alert Threshold Rationale

### Time-based Thresholds
| Resource Type | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| GitRepository | 5 minutes | Git operations should be fast; delays indicate connectivity issues |
| Kustomization/HelmRelease | 10 minutes | Allows for complex resource processing and retry cycles |
| Controller Health | 1-5 minutes | Controllers should be consistently available |
| Resource Termination | 5-10 minutes | Allows for graceful shutdown while catching stuck states |

### Performance Thresholds
| Metric | Threshold | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Error Rate | >10% | Balance between noise and real issues |
| Reconciliation Time (95th percentile) | >30 seconds | Normal reconciliation should be sub-second to few seconds |
| System Degradation | >20% failed resources | Indicates systemic issues requiring immediate attention |

## Integration Points

### Prometheus Configuration
- Alert rules automatically discovered by Prometheus Operator
- Rules evaluated every 30-60 seconds based on criticality
- Integrated with existing ServiceMonitor/PodMonitor setup

### Grafana Integration
- Alert annotations provide troubleshooting guidance
- Compatible with existing Flux dashboards (16713, 16714)
- Recording rules available for dashboard queries

### Troubleshooting Integration
Each alert includes:
- Clear problem description
- Potential root causes
- Specific kubectl commands for investigation
- Links to relevant documentation

## Validation Results

✅ **YAML Syntax**: All files pass yamllint validation
✅ **Kustomization Build**: Successfully builds with kubectl kustomize
✅ **PrometheusRule Structure**: Valid Kubernetes resources
✅ **Alert Metadata**: Complete summary and description for all alerts
✅ **Integration**: Properly integrated with monitoring stack

## Alert Coverage Summary

### Flux Controller Monitoring
- Source Controller: Git repository sync issues
- Kustomize Controller: Kustomization build and apply issues  
- Helm Controller: Helm release management issues
- Notification Controller: Event and webhook issues

### GitOps Operational Patterns
- Resource lifecycle management (stuck termination)
- Deployment rollout monitoring
- Resource conflict detection
- Performance degradation tracking

### System Health Monitoring
- Overall system health scoring
- Controller availability tracking
- Performance trend analysis
- Capacity planning metrics

## Next Steps

The alert rules are ready for deployment and will be automatically applied when the monitoring infrastructure is reconciled. The next logical steps are:

1. **Task 2.4**: Build GitOps health monitoring dashboard
2. **Task 2.5**: Test alerting with simulated stuck states
3. **Future**: Configure Alertmanager for notification routing
